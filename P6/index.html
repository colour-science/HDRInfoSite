    <h2><small> Introduction:</small></h2>
    <small>The objective here was to make a simple animated pattern to
      show banding at the limit of visibility to test performance of 10
      and 12 bit displays.&nbsp; To give the eye something to track it
      was decided to animate a simple bouncing ball. To show a banding
      pattern a gray field was chosen which will be modified in color
      (and luminance) by a "percent" input parameter to the frame
      animation program as follows:<br>
      <br>
      - Pattern size is 1920x1080<br>
      - input "-frame &lt;number&gt;" caused the program to write a n<sup>th</sup>
      single frame.<br>
      - input "-speed &lt;number&gt;" sets the speed of the bouncing
      ball. A low speed like 3 is good if rendering the frames at 24
      fps. At 23.976 fps rendering the ball moves 30 pixels per second
      horizontally and 10 pixels per second vertically with speed=1 or
      1.25*speed pixels per frame horizontally and 0.42*speed pixels per
      frame vertically.<br>
      - input "-percent &lt;number&gt;" is the percent of variation
      applied to the image used at +/- that percent.&nbsp; Percent is
      relative to the gray level of the image. Described below:<br>
      <br>
      The objective is to be able to make any frame of the pattern (e.g.
      -input #) and then later scale the pattern up and down to be able
      to use it at any brightness setting that way a sequence of frames
      can be used across a large range of f-stops.<br>
      <br>
      Each frame is written the same way as a full scale 16 bit integer
      TIFF (0-65535):<br>
      - gray level is 32000<br>
      - one percent is 320<br>
      <br>
      This is done so that variation is created in percent from gray and
      allows the created images to be used at any brightness setting yet
      still have the same percent variation which is important when
      visually looking for variation at Barten/Weber levels of 0.2%-5%
      (nominally 0.5%-1%) <br>
      <br>
      Each frame is constructed so that luminance and color ramps are
      created from the bouncing ball to the four corners, top-center and
      bottom-center of the image. The bouncing ball is gray with a level
      of minus "percent" from the gray level.<br>
      <br>
      Each pixel value outside the ball is computed as follows:<br>
      - distance from the pixel to each of the 4 corners and mid points
      listed.<br>
      - distance from the edge of the ball to the current pixel<br>
      - "ramp" scaler of distance to corner divided by total ball to
      pixel and pixel to corner distance. This will be near zero when
      the ball is close to a wall/corner and approach 0.25 to 0.5 when
      the ball is distant from a corner/wall. A scale factor of
      (1-ramp)*percent is used to offset RGB (color/luminance)<br>
      <br>
      This will result in color/luminance ramps over the entire field of
      the image to each corner and top bottom spots.<br>
      <br>
      Top-Left:&nbsp; Red plus<br>
      Bottom-Left: Red minus<br>
      Top-Right: Blue plus<br>
      Bottom-Right: Blue minus<br>
      Top-Center: Green minus<br>
      Bottom-Center Green plus<br>

            For the HDR banding test a sequence of frames were generated
            at many brightness levels each RGB frame was treated as P3
            RGB and put into a Rec 2020 EXR container (linear) as well
            as a 10000 nit PQ Rec 2020 TIFF container. At each
            brightness level two frames were created.<br>
            <br>
            To give an idea of this sequence it was tone mapped to 1000
            nits and put into a normal 8-bit 709 container and AVC
            compressed to play back at 2 fps. (<a

                #4) were then I-Frame HEVC compressed using qp=12. The

                re-sampled back to RGB and compared using sigma_compare
                to the 16 bit Integer version and plotted. Note there is
                very little degradation from the YUV step, but also no
                noise in these patterns so HEVC is clearly able to at
                this setting nearly losslessly compress this pattern. So
                is there banding visible?</small><br>
