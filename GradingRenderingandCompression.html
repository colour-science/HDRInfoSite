    <h2><small> Introduction:</small></h2>
    <small><br>
      An "ACES" style workflow and compression follows the following
      basic steps:</small><br>
    <ul>
      <li><small>Camera Recording</small></li>
      <li><small>Conformance into ACES through an Input Display
          Transform "IDT". These are the souce images in EXR format, D60
          whitepoint and ACES color space used for color grading.</small></li>
      <li><small>Color Grading (while viewing the result through an
          RRT+ODT on a reference monitor).&nbsp; The color grade,
          without the RRT+ODT rendering, is baked into a set of EXRs
          that remain ACES color space, D60 whitepoint. This is
          sometimes called "ACES'" or Graded and Pre-Rendered files.</small></li>
      <li><small>Rendering the Color Grade using a Reference Rendering
          Transform (RRT) and a Output Display Transform (ODT). The RRT
          imparts the slope increase to convert scene referred light
          (photons) into display referred light (indoor viewing) and the
          ODT further adjusts the color space and display EOTF to match
          the desired deliverable conditions. This is the "master" used
          for distribution.</small></li>
      <li><small>YUV processing. For 4:2:0 transport streams a FIR
          filter subsampling process is used for HDR to avoid issues
          that are present from simple box, triangle or other
          subsamplers in some of the tools currently used for SDR.</small></li>
      <li><small>HEVC compression</small></li>
    </ul>
    <small><br>

    <hr size="2" width="100%"><b>Rendering: RRT + ODT</b><b>:</b><br>
    <br>
    You'll need to select a RRT and ODT to use based on the information
    provided from the grading suite. Currently this is under
    investigation by many people:<br>
    <a href="https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/tree/v1.0"><br>
      AMPAS/ACES</a>: With version 1.0 there are three experimental ODTs
    provided for 1000, 2000 and 4000 nits. Supports P3 D60 PQ only.<br>
    <br>
    <a
      href="https://github.com/quantizationbit/DPXEXR/tree/master/nugget">Nugget:</a>
    This transform is under development by Gary Demos and it attempting
    to address rendering issues that are unique to HDR in the 200-1000+
    nit range in terms of color management through rendering and in
    display adaptation. Very specific in support of P3, D60, Gamma or PQ
    output.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://github.com/quantizationbit/CTLs">v71:</a>&nbsp;
    This is a modification of the AMPAS/ACES v71 video ODTs where the
    ODT tone curve is lifted to the desired HDR output range. It is
    setup to support any range of HDR and display colorspace.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://github.com/quantizationbit/CTLa1">v10:</a> This is
    a modification by Bill Mandel of the AMPAS/ACES v10 video ODTs where
    the ODTs were modified to support D65, Rec709/2020 color and some
    change to the 1000 nit output.<br>
    <br>
    For each of these a command line script that either runs "ctl" files
    as a direct compute using ctlrender or implements the transform as a
    LUT is needed to implement.<br>
    <br>
    <hr size="2" width="100%"><b>YUV:</b><br>
    <br>
    This <a href="https://github.com/quantizationbit/YUV">tool</a>
    developed by Bill Mandel with the subsampling FIR filter contributed
    by Chad Fogg implements creation of a YUV frame from a TIFF input
    file. Many options are provided:&nbsp; HD, UHD, Rec709, Rec2020,
    YDzDx, Non-Constant Luminance, Constant Luminance.&nbsp; It is used
    in a loop as the tool reads one tiff and appends it to a YUV file.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr size="2" width="100%"><b>HEVC:</b><br>
    <br>
    Multiple tools exist from many vendors:&nbsp; Multicoreware (x265),
    Vanguard, ATEME, ...<br>
    <br>
    As <a href="https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265/wiki/Home">x265</a>
    is open source it is straightforward to use for examples.<br>
    <br>
    <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
    <b>Examples:</b><br>
    <br>
    Recently (April 2015) the UHDSC at the ASC has been looking at
    producing content for display interoperability testing and
    discussion and multiple grades were created to assist with better
    understanding issues around HDR.&nbsp; One of these grades was
    created with v71 and v10 above and there is a version of Nugget
    above that has a very similar look to v71.&nbsp; Below are some
    examples of processing this graded but pre-rendered material output
    from this grading session:<br>
